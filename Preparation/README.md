# Preparation 

Our workshop assumes some basic knowledge about Python programming language and scientific libraries for data analysis and visualization. The notebooks in this directory are prepared to cover the basics and get you started to learn basic tools for scientific data analysis in Python.

1. [Python-01-Jupyter.ipynb](https://github.com/drinkingkazu/tmp_slacml/blob/master/Preparation/Python-01-Jupyter.ipynb)
  - an introduction to `Jupyter` notebook which will be used as the coding/execution platform throughout the workshop.
2. [Python-02-Python.ipynb](https://github.com/drinkingkazu/tmp_slacml/blob/master/Preparation/Python-02-Python.ipynb)
  - an introduction to `Python` as a programming language. We cover data types and useful built-in functions as well as how to define a _function_ and _class_ in Python.
3. [Python-03-Numpy.ipynb](https://github.com/drinkingkazu/tmp_slacml/blob/master/Preparation/Python-03-Numpy.ipynb)
  - an introduction to `numpy`, the most popular scientific library in Python that is used as the base or supported by other scientific libraries. We cover data types, arrays and operations on arrays, linear algebra, random numbers, etc.
4. [Python-04-ScientificPython.ipynb](https://github.com/drinkingkazu/tmp_slacml/blob/master/Preparation/Python-04-Jupyter.ipynb)
  - an introduction to visualization tools, fitting a function, saving data into a file, etc..
